# EigenLayer MCP Server built on Next.js

Inspired by initial testing [here](https://x.com/dabit3/status/1902502245855383724).
Cloned from [Vercel Next.js MCP template](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/model-context-protocol-mcp-with-next-js)

## Goals
- Provides EigenLayer documentation, source code, and useful content to Claude and other AI assistants via [MCP protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction).
- Runs as a standalone server locally or hosted.

## Access

**Public URL:** https://mcp.eigenlayer.xyz/sse

## Features

**Resources:** The following resource endpoints are currently available:
- eigenlayer-blog-all-articles-combined
- eigenlayer-docs-overview
- eigenlayer-docs-developer
- eigenlayer-middleware-docs
- eigenlayer-middleware-src
- eigenlayer-contracts-src

**Tools:** no tool endpoints are currently exposed. They will likely be added in future releases.


# Test the public endpoint with Claude:

1) Add the live URL to Claude via the following command (in any folder):  
   ```claude mcp add --transport sse eigenlayer-mcp-server https://mcp.eigenlayer.xyz/sse```
2) Install [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview). Run command `claude` to enter Claude Code and confirm the  mcp server is added
3) Test with a query like "Can you explain how EigenLayer's restaking mechanism works?"
